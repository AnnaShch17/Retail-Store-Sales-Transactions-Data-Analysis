# Retail-Store-Sales-Transactions-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this data analysis project is to get understanding of the business trends for the retail store in 2016.

Analyzing retail store sales transactions can provide important insights that help optimize business operations, boost sales, and improve the customer experience.


## Data Source

The dataset that I used for my analysis is Retail Store Sales Transactions.

This anonymized dataset includes 64.558 unique transactions of 5.239 SKU's sold to 22.610 customers in a retail store during the year of 2016 in Slovakia. Dataset contains the following information: Date of Sales Transaction, Customer ID, Transaction ID, SKU Category ID, SKU ID, Quantity Sold, Sales Amount. Also, I calculated Unit Price by dividing Sales Amount by Quantity.

Detailed information on consumer goods sales gathered by scanning product barcodes at electronic points of sale in the retail stores. This data includes information about quantities, characteristics, prices of the items sold.


## Tools

1.	Excel and Power Query - I used Excel and Power Query for Data Cleaning.
2.	Power BI - I used Power BI for Data Analysis.


## Data Cleaning and Preparation

During the initial data preparation phase, I completed the following tasks:
1.	Data loading and inspection.
2.	Handling errors, missing values, outliers.
   
Comprehensive sales data for consumer goods collected by scanning the barcodes of individual products at electronic checkout points in retail stores. This information includes details about the quantity, attributes, prices, and total value of the products sold.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

During the analysis of the retail store sales transactions, the following questions were considered:

1.	What are the total sales over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)?
2.	Which products and product categories generate the most profit?
3.	What is the average unit price? 
4.	What is the total revenue and total quantity of items sold, and the total number of transactions?
5.	What type of customers (repeat customers or one-time buyers) contributes the most to the revenue?
6.	What is the correlation between product price and revenue?
7.	Are there seasonal impacts on customer purchasing behavior?
